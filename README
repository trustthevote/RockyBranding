The Rocky Branding Package is the set of files that are required
to complement those in the Rocky repo. The Branding Package files
are those that may be changed for a specific deployment, to
implement branding specific to that deployment, e.g., a 
different header banner.

The Branding Package has a number of files that start with "example".
Each of these is a stand-in for a file that must be supplied for
each deployment. For each of these, 
	cp examplefoo foo
and edit the new file to insert the data appropriate to the 
deployment, often the name the of organization that is 
sponsoring the deployment.
